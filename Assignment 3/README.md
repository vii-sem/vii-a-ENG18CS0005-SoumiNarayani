Debugging in JS
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.
Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.
There are mainly 3 methods in debugging JS:
1. The console.log() method
2. Setting breakpoints
3. The debugger keyword
1.Console.log() method:
The console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined
before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
Syntax:
console.log(A);
